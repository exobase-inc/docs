# Testable

Testability is a must. Many of these core principles are closely related. Isolated our business logic allows it to be easily understood and changed. It also allows us to easily test it. Ideally, testing is as simple as providing input and asserting output. With composable hooks and isolated endpoint functions it usually is that easy.
